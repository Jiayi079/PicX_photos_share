# Description:
The website will be a fully functional web application where users will be able to register accounts, log into registered accounts, post images(only can be done by registered users), and search images (searching can be done by either registered users or guests). 

Language used: JavaScrip, Handlebars, MySQL, CSS

Some of the features I will implement in the future:
1. Using Amazon AWS make website become open sourse
2. Update some JS features to make the website looks better
    - Registration page: email's verification code
    - Registration page: password valid/invalide mention need to be more clear
    - All pages's css style need to be set up better
    - Website's logo need to be set up(link to the home page)
    - Post detail page: after click the submit comment, whole page need to be refreshed automatically
    - Post detail page: comment's time need to be update become exactly time, mins, and seconds
